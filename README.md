# Number Guesser

Number Guesser is a simple console-based game built in Java. It allows users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation**: Generates a random number between a user-defined minimum and maximum value.
- **User Input**: Allows users to input their guesses and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Limited Attempts**: Limits the number of attempts per game and informs the user when they have exceeded the limit.
- **Scoring System**: Calculates and displays the user's score based on the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.
- **Play Again**: Gives users the option to play multiple rounds of the game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse to run the application

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

### Usage

1. Run the `NumberGuesserMain` class as a Java application.
2. Enter the minimum and maximum values for the range of numbers to guess.
3. Guess the randomly generated number within the specified range.
4. Receive feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. Keep guessing until you either guess the correct number or exceed the maximum number of attempts.
6. Choose to play again or exit the game.

## Project Structure

- `NumberGuesserMain.java`: Contains the main class to run the Number Guesser game.
- `NumberGuesser.java`: Contains the logic for generating random numbers, processing user input, and determining the outcome of each guess.

## Learnings

- Practiced user input handling and conditional logic in Java.
- Learned about random number generation and basic game mechanics.
- Explored different strategies for limiting the number of attempts and providing feedback to the user.
